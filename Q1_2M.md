## 1. Analyse the term integrity constraints. (L4)
**Answer:**
Integrity constraints are rules applied on data to maintain accuracy and consistency in a database.  
There are three main types:
- **Domain Constraints**: Restrict column values (e.g., `age > 0`)
- **Entity Integrity**: No NULLs in primary key
- **Referential Integrity**: Foreign keys must match a valid primary key in another table

**Example:**  
A `booking` table's `customer_id` should match an `id` in the `customers` table (referential integrity).

## 2. Define functional dependence. (L1)
**Answer:**
A functional dependency occurs when one attribute uniquely determines another.  
If A â†’ B, then for every value of A, there is exactly one value of B.

**Example:**  
In a table `Employee(EmpID, Name, Department)`, `EmpID â†’ Name` because each EmpID maps to one employee.

## 3. Paraphrase about Dense Index. (L2)
**Answer:**
A Dense Index is a type of index where **every search key value** has an entry in the index file along with a pointer to the actual record.

**Example:**  
If a table has 5 records with `emp_id`, the index will have 5 entries â€” one for each record.

## 4. Expand RAID and its purpose. (L2)
**Answer:**
**RAID**: Redundant Array of Independent Disks  
RAID combines multiple physical drives into one unit to improve **fault tolerance** and **read/write performance**.

**Example:**  
- **RAID 1 (Mirroring)**: Data is copied to two drives for redundancy.
- **RAID 5 (Striping + Parity)**: Distributes data with parity across disks to tolerate one disk failure.

## 5. Name some of the performance measure of disks. (L1)
**Answer:**
- **Seek Time**: Time to move the disk head to the desired track.
- **Rotational Latency**: Time for the disk to rotate to the desired sector.
- **Transfer Time**: Time to read/write data.
- **Access Time**: Sum of seek time and rotational latency.

---

## 6. What is shadow paging? Mention any one disadvantage of it. (L2)
**Answer:**
Shadow Paging is a recovery technique that keeps a **shadow copy** of the database pages before a transaction begins. If a failure occurs, the system reverts to the shadow copy.

**Disadvantage:**  
- High overhead due to **page copying**, especially for large transactions.
- Difficult to manage in a system with frequent updates.

---

## 7. List the ACID properties. (NOV 2015/2019) (L1)
**Answer:**
- **Atomicity**: All steps in a transaction are completed or none.
- **Consistency**: Data remains in a valid state before and after a transaction.
- **Isolation**: Transactions execute independently.
- **Durability**: Changes made are permanent even after a system crash.

**Example:**  
If a payment fails mid-way, Atomicity ensures no amount is deducted.

---

## 8. Name the various phases of two-phase locking protocol. (APR/MAY 2014) (L1)
**Answer:**
- **Growing Phase**: Transaction can acquire locks but not release.
- **Shrinking Phase**: Transaction can release locks but not acquire new ones.

**Purpose:**  
This protocol ensures **serializability** and prevents **conflicts** in concurrent transactions.
